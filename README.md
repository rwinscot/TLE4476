TLE4476
=======

This is a breakout for the Infineon TLE4476 monolithic integrated regulator with dual outputs: 3.3v @ 350mA and 5v @ 430mA. It requires only three components... capacitors. It features a wide voltage operation range, reverse battery protection, wide temperature range, etc. etc. Take a look at the datasheet for all the juicy details. It's an attractive package for harsh environments.

I've tried to make the input on this breakout friendly to PC terminals, barrel connector, and bare wires. Also, the entire board serves as a heat-sink for the IC.


##NOTE
This is a surface mount design... you'll need either some way to reflow or a hot-air reword station for best results. You might be able to do this with a soldering iron - no guarantees.
